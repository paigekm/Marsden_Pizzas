<h1 id="1">Sprint One</h1>
                
        <p>A program which offers a basic main menu, with an option to either View the pizza menu, or Quit the program. <br>If the user chooses the Quit option, they are asked for confirmation to either end the program or return to the main menu.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>This first sprint was successful as I created a basic program as outlined in the aim. The confirmation option was important to avoid miscommunication.<br>Next step is to create a feature to start ordering; add a pizza and store this information in an order list.</p><hr>

<h1 id="2">Sprint Two</h1>
                
                <p>A program which allows the user to enter the customer's pizza order and stores this information. <br><br>This sprint's 'add' function, adds a new pizza to the order. When this function is called, it prints the pizza menu, requests user input of the index number for the pizza type they would like to order, and requests an integer entry for how many of that pizza type they would like. <br>Finally, it prints their order so far in a simple format.</p>

                <h4>Testing</h4><br>

                    <h5>Frau:</h5><video class="img-responsive" width="600" controls>
                    <source src="assets/videos/frau_testing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>
                    <p>After Frau tested my programme, in confirming whether they want to quit, instead of having Q and B, I used ‘Y’ and ‘N’ because Frau tried to enter those commands. <br> I also found out I needed to clarify what an index number is, so I added an extra column heading saying “index” to give frau an idea of what she needs to enter when asked to choose a pizza.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Errors</h4>
                    <p>Below are some Errors I found when testing Sprint Two, and how I addressed/or plan to address them.</p>
                    <ol>

                    </video><br>
                    <br><h5>Solution to error:</h5>
                    <p>I will address this error in Sprint Three, by creating a validated integer entry function which does not allow the user to enter a pizza index that is out of range, and will give feedback.</p><br></li>
                
                    <li><h5>Using the pizza's index number (rather than pizza name) when printing the receipt and user messages</h5>

<h1 id="5">Sprint Five</h1>
                <p>My Sprint 5 is about creating an update function. This new update option in the menu allows the user to review their current order status, to remove   currently ordered pizzas or to change the number of pizzas ordered. </p>
<h4>Purpose of Sprint 5</h4>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/purpose_version5.JPG" alt=""> <br>

<h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>Through testing I realised that my get validated integer function, which limited the user to only ordering 5 pizzas of one type maximum, wasn't working in this update function.</p><br>

<h1 id="6">Sprint Six</h1>
                                <p>In this Sprint, rather than creating a new function, I decided to run a "Cancel order" feature in the Main Menu. In all the functions that the user could be led to through the other menu options, there s always a quit option available which returns them to the main menu. This means this new Cancel feature is easily accessible from anywhere in the program, addressing the implication of Functionality.</p>

<h1 id="A">User test with a customer situation</h1>
                                <p>I carried out a user test with Mr Khouri, at the point when my program was developed up to the end of Sprint 6. </p>

            <hr>
            <h5>Things I learnt from this test:</h5>
                <p>I accidentally selected the add option, because of the customer's langauge saying they want to add one more Australia pizza. I should have selected the update option. In future the add option should lead to the update function, if that pizza type has already got some pizzas in the order.</p>

                                    <p>I ran my main_program code through WOF code checker and resolved any final style issues. One that I was surprised by, was that a function name cannot contain capitals, eg. get_validated_integer_Y_or_N was invalid!<br> I also ran the validations file's code through the checker and resolved all style issues. <br>Finally, I used the feature in PyCharm, which shows errors and explains why in a side panel, to resolve any other issues.</p>

                                <p>Error as mentioned in above video, the validation feedback for phone number mentions character length before character type. I think it makes more logical sense to check the entry is only numbers and dashes, before worrying about entry length. I also had to adapt the length of the phone number from max 11 characters to 15, because I allow dashes in the entry, and up to 3 or 4 dashes are normally added to each phone number. So I changed this and now the error messages for phone number entry appear like this:</p>

                                    <p>When developing this program, I used Agile practices. I developed the program, incrementally using iterations, as each new feature required a new function and a new testing file. I also used Agile as we used 'Scrum' and held StandUps at the start of each lesson working on the program.<br>
                                    As seen above with Git commit history and Kanban boards, I also used Git (for version control) and Github (remote repository). This enabled me to restore any previous iterations of the program if I wanted. Anytime I wanted to add a new feature, I used a new Kanban Sprint Board on GitHub to plan, and then created a new testing file on Git (to integrate into my main program). Regularly I carried out Git Commits, to ensure the remote repository Github, held the most recent version of my planning site and program.

<h1 id="R"> Relevant Implications Summary</h1><br>
                                
                                <h4><b>Future Proofing</b></h4><br>
                                <p><b>Describe: </b>This relevant implication considers whether or not it is easy to update and add new features to the program. A well ‘Future Proofed’ program would allow a different programmer to update and add features. For this reason, to ensure Future Proofing the code has to be ‘easy’ for other programmers to understand.</p>
                                <p><b>Address:</b>
                                The main way I addressed Future Proofing, was by using docstrings to describe the purpose of all my functions, and using extensive commenting to describe the purpose of other sections of code. This makes it easier for another programmer to be quickly “onboarded” into my project, and understand how the design decisions I made, work.<br>
                                I also addressed this implication by using code checkers to ensure my code fits with python conventions. This ensures all tab indents, spacings and line lengths fit the conventions that the new programmer is familiar with.<br>
                                I further addressed Future Proofing, by building my program around a function structure. This means that when a new feature is to be added, this implies a new function. This makes my program easier to navigate and informs a programmer the way to add a new feature.<br>This function based structure of my program, also means that changes and new features can easily be integrated into the main program - as a new function can be tested in a testing file first, then integrated smoothly.
                                </p>
                                 <hr>
                                
                                <h4><b>Functionality</b></h4><br>
                                <p><b>Describe:</b>
                                A functional program works well and loads quickly. This relevant implication ensures that the program is free from bugs or glitches and does not crash. Functionality is also considered, as a program needs to add up and store values correctly. The program should also be able to work and appear properly on all browsers and devices, and all the links should work correctly.</p>
                                <p><b>Address:</b> I addressed this implication through regular testing. I tested each function in a testing file for that Sprint, and then tested again after integrating into the main program. This ensured that my program was functional and that found any bugs or potential crashes before the program finished. 
                                <br>I further addressed Functionality, by designing and executing 2 extensive scenario tests throughout. I planned “order stories” to replicate a real life user situation, for extensive testing of my program’s Functionality.
                                </p>

                                <h4><b>Usability</b></h4><br>
                                <p><b>Describe:</b>
                                This implication is about ensuring the program is easy to use. Usability is about helping and ensuring the user can recognise, diagnose and recover from errors. Usability ensures the user can not only avoid errors, but that the program can also correct errors without having to worry the user.
                                <br>Usability also includes being able to restore a previous state. This implication ensures the program follows usability heuristics, uses recognised conventions and matches the real world.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Address:</b> The main way I addressed Usability was through validations. By creating functions to validate string and integer user entries, I ensured the program was easy to use. The validation functions edit the entry immediately (eg. capitalising it) to prevent bothering the user too much, but if it is still invalid it prints an error message and reasks for entry (preventing the program from crashing). 
                                <br>I addressed this implication, through confirmation and error messages. Confirmation messages ensure that my program meets the usability heuristic of ‘Visibility of System Status’, as these messages communicate the program status and where it is in the process eg. “4 more pizzas have successfully been added”. I also asked for confirmation several times, before making an action, because this makes the program easy to use, minimises the impact of errors and helps the user recover quickly if they make an entry error.

                                <br><br>I further addressed the usability heuristic ‘Visibility of System Status’ by creating a Review option in the main menu, which allows the user to review their order progress so far. This lets the user make informed decisions while they continue running the program. I also included Back options which helps the user recover from errors, as they can return to their previous place in the program.

                                <br>I addressed Usability by implementing a main menu system. This is a familiar format for the user to understand which makes it easier to understand and use. This also provided a ‘home point’ which they are always returned back to, which makes the experience easier as they know where they are so can orient themselves in the program. The concept of a ‘Home page’ is a recognised convention and matches the real world idea of a ‘homebase’. 

                                <br>Finally, I addressed this implication by uploading all files to and using GitHub to manage my files. GitHub allows the programmer to restore a previous state of their program during the design process.
